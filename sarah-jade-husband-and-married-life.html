She is currently 34 years old. In terms of her schooling, she graduated from the University of South Florida in 2011 with a degree in sociology.</p><h2><span id=Dave_Bautista_and_Sarah_Jade_were_married>Dave Bautista and Sarah Jade were married.</span></h2><p>Following her marriage to former WWE wrestler-husband Dave Bautista, Sara became well-known in the media. In October 2015, the husband and wife tied the knot. There were only a few close friends and family members present at their modest wedding.</p><p>The couple looked quite stylish in their clothes. While Dave looked sharp in the black tux, Sara wore an ivory, sleeveless bridal gown with Grecian-style lace and a dazzling headband.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite having a wonderful beginning, the pair is no longer together. In early 2019, after nearly four years of marriage, they decided to call it quits and split up.</p><p>Bautista was married to Glenda Bautista from 1990 till 1998 before meeting Jade. From 1998 to 2006, he was married to Angie Bautista in his second marriage. Along with Keilani Bautista and Athena Bautista from her first marriage, he also has three children from his second marriage, Oliver Bautista.</p><h2><span id=Was_Sarah_Jade_a_Mother>Was Sarah Jade a Mother?</span></h2><p>Despite having been married for a long time, she never welcomed children into her marriage. She doesn’t appear to have any plans to have children as of 2022.</p><h2><span id=Pole_dancer_Sarah_Jade_Is_A_Proficient_Artist>Pole dancer Sarah Jade Is A Proficient Artist</span></h2><p>Jade is an instructor and one of the top pole dancers at the moment. Throughout the course of her more than ten-year career, she has competed on numerous reputable stages and maintained her status as a champion.</p><p>She has previously participated in competitions such as the “Florida Pole and Aerial Arts Showcase,” “USPDF Amateur Nationals,” and “Pole for a Purpose.”</p><p>In a same vein, she won the Florida Pole Fitness Championship’s pro division in 2012 and 2013.</p><p>Her other notable performances included those in the following events: “Vertitheal Desires,” “Miss Pole Dance America,” “Nude Nite Aerialist,” “Pole Show La Soloist,” “USPDF Battle for Armageddon,” and “Dance Filthy.”</p><p>In addition, she is an X-Pole Athlete and the 2016 Miss Pole Dancing America.</p><h2><span id=She_also_has_her_own_business>She also has her own business.</span></h2><p>In addition to being a dancer, Sara Jade, the ex-spouse of Dave Bautista, is also an entrepreneur who has taught dance techniques.

The woman has been spending a lot of time lately with a new man who seems to be her boyfriend. She hasn’t disclosed the identity of the new man in her life, though.</p><p>It appears that she and the fortunate man have already taken a holiday to France. Jade shared a throwback image from her vacation to France with her “boyfriend” on February 1, 2020.</p><p>Later on February 28, she sent him a fresh picture. The duo appeared to have wonderful chemistry in a gorgeous photo. The image was captioned, “Take me back to beautiful Colorado,” by her.</p><p>It’s clear that Sara and he are dating even though she hasn’t disclosed their relationship. I hope she soon announces her relationship.</p><p>She and her mother are quite close to an excellent relationship with her mother, just like any daughter would. She has published some of her mother’s images on Instagram, but she hasn’t disclosed her identity.</p><p>It goes without saying that she always expresses her gratitude to her mother on social media.

Her family is firmly middle-class and has never been involved in dance.</p><p>The 32-year-old began her professional life by taking low-paying jobs. She even had a bartending job in Florida, which is when her passion for pole dancing began.</p><p>She quickly began studying pole dancing, eventually making a career out of her pastime.</p><h2><span id=Jade_Uses_Social_Media_Frequently>Jade Uses Social Media Frequently</span></h2><p>Sara is a well-known person on social media, particularly on Twitter and Instagram.
