Bill had taken a desk job at the bank so that he could assist the Order of the Phoenix, and the two meet and began dating immediately.</strong></p><p>Thereof Why was Fleur Delacour disqualified? Fleur Delacour failed to finish the second task <b>because she was attacked by the grindylows</b>. … Cedric, and then Krum, arrive and retrieve their hostages, but when Fleur failed to show, Harry threatened the Merpeople with his wand, and retrieved Gabrielle in addition to Ron.</p><p>Is Fleur Delacour a pure blood? Fleur Delacour is part Veela. So <b>she is not a pureblood</b>. Purebloods were considered 100 % mixtures of magical parents at least several generations back. However, all the magical families had some infusion of muggle blood at some time in their past.</p><p>Subsequently, Was Fleur Delacour a Weasley? Fleur Isabelle Weasley (née Delacour) (born c. 1977) was a French, quarter-<b>Veela witch</b> daughter of Monsieur and Apolline Delacour and elder sister of Gabrielle. Fleur began attending the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in 1988. … Fleur fought alongside her husband during the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Lavender_Brown_a_werewolf></span>Is Lavender Brown a werewolf?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><p>Does Fleur Delacour have a sister? Gabrielle Delacour was a quarter-Veela French witch, the daughter of Monsieur Delacour and Apolline Delacour. She <b>had one older sister, Fleur</b>.</p><p>Would Fleur have said yes to Ron? Importantly, Ginny explains the situation while Hermione <b>says Fleur would never say yes to Ron</b>. Ron then tells his friends he yelled at Fleur to go out with him before he ran for his life. Ginny comments that Ron’s encounter ‘was a bit frightening’. Her words, not mine.</p><p>Did any Weasley marry a pureblood? All the Weasleys (born before the end of the War) <b>are Pure Blood</b> – their marriages do not change their blood status. They remain Pure Blood regardless. However, if Ron and Hermione’s children married Pure Bloods, then their children would still be considered Half-Blood as their grandmother is a Muggle-born.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_two_Muggles_have_wizard_child></span>Can two Muggles have wizard child?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Yes it is possible for two Muggles to have a wizard child</b>; common examples are Hermione Granger, whose parents are Muggle dentists, and Lily Evans, who is Harry’s mother.</p><p>Are the Weasleys related to the black family? Through Cedrella, the Weasley family is <b>related not only to the Black family</b>, but also to the Crouch and Longbottom families. Through Arthur, she has seven grandchildren.</p><p>What beauxbatons house was Fleur Delacour in?</p><p><b>Ravenclaw</b>– the Beauxbatons delegation, including Fleur, sat at the Ravenclaw table during the Triwizard Tournament, and one would have to be very intelligent to compete in the Triwizard Tournament as she did.</p><p>Which Harry Potter is the wedding in? In the first part film adaption of <b>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</b>, in which the wedding took place, several differences were made: Madame Maxime appeared at the wedding in the film version, which is notable since she did not appear in the novel.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_put_Harry%E2%80%99s_name_in_the_Goblet_of_Fire></span>Who put Harry’s name in the Goblet of Fire?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It was <b>Barty Crouch Jr imposing</b> as Mad-Eye Moody who put Harry’s name in the Goblet of Fire. That was only in the movie. It was Barty Crouch Jr. It could not have been Karakoff because Voldemort says that he had a loyal death eater at Hogwarts right now when he got his body back.</p><p>Is Voldemort a virgin?</p><p>By the time he was Lord Voldemort (despite what I said earlier about the graveyard scene), Tom Riddle had become fully and completely asexual. So my answer to the question is yes, <b>Lord Voldemort was a virgin</b>.</p><p>Was Bill Weasley a werewolf? <b>Bill did not become a werewolf</b> but did develop a liking for very rare steaks. It was his injuries that finally convinced his mother that Fleur was the right choice for him.</p><p>Did Ron and Lavender sleep together? <b>Ron and Lavender had sex soon after getting together</b>. Since they were both virgins the sex sucked. This turned Ron off of the relationship and made Lavender extra clingy. Their feelings in this direction continued to get worse over time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_did_Gabrielle_Delacour_marry></span>Who did Gabrielle Delacour marry?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After graduating from Beauxbatons, Gabrielle married <b>Mateo Maximoff</b>, with whom she began a relationship with in the summer of 2003.</p><p>How old was Fleur Delacour when she got married? Fleur Delacour is <b>at most 21</b> when she marries Bill Weasley, who is a bit older, at 26. Although we don’t know exactly when Harry and Ginny get married, Ginny was 22 and Harry was 23 when they had their first child, which means that we can probably guess that they got married a year or two earlier than that.</p><p>How tall is Fleur Delacour in the books?</p><p>Fleur Delecour is <b>5 foot 7 inches (1.70 m)</b> tall.</p><p>What is Veela in Harry Potter? Veela are <b>semi-human magical beings</b>; beautiful women with white-gold hair and skin that appears to shine moon-bright. When angry, Veela take on a less pleasant appearance; their faces elongate into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long scaly wings burst from their shoulders.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_cursed_Krum></span>Who cursed Krum?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>During the task, <b>Barty Crouch Jnr, posing as Alastor Moody</b> by way of the Polyjuice Potion, managed to place the Imperius Curse on Viktor as part of his plot to steer Harry Potter to victory in the Tournament. Under Moody’s control, he caught up with Cedric and performed the Cruciatus Curse on him.</p><p>How are the Weasleys poor? Ron’s generation of Weasleys were considered <b>poor by wizarding standards</b>; their vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank only contained a small pile of Sickles and a single Galleon as of 1992. For several generations, only boys were born into the family, until the birth of Ginevra Molly Weasley.</p><p>Did Percy Weasley get married?</p><p><b>Percy eventually married a woman named Audrey</b>, and the couple had two daughters, Molly and Lucy.</p><p>Is Dumbledore a pureblood? No, Dumbledore is not a pure-blood, but in fact, <b>he is a half-blood</b>. Although both of his parents were magical, his mother was a Muggle-born, which technically gives Albus the status of a half-blood.</p><h2></h2><p>Don’t forget to share this post 🖤</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1ktbDDjJ2gnWWWobK2voydnKWZk6TCs3nMnpytZZKeua151p6YrKSVrnw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./john-isner-and-reilly-opelka-contest-longest-ever-tiebreak.html>&#171;&nbsp;John Isner and Reilly Opelka contest longest ever tiebreak</a>
